		<h1>Now, let's try and see the difference between spans and divs</h1>

		<span>span1</span>
		<span>span1</span>

		<div>div1</div>
		<div>Block element</div>

		<p
			>Basically, the onyl difference between div and spans is that the
			div is a block element, which takes the full width space of the
			line, like a block. On the other hand, span is an inline element,
			which means it takes as much space as it needs. There can be two
			spans within one line, but there can't be two divs within the same
			line.
